This is a Tic Tac Toe game which i have build while i was learning to code in flutter<br>
### About the Game
In this game there are two modes one of which a user can choose at a time to play.<br>
First mode is to play with a computer in which you are there to play against a computer.<br>
The secod mode is the human mode in which two humans play agains each other.<br>
Like every other game it has three parameters for result i.e. Win, Lose, Tie which are decided at the end of each game accordingly.
